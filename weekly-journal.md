# Weekly journal

This is inspired by Kirstie Whitaker's weekly reports and the encouragement from OLS fellow Maya Sundukova to write down what I spend my time on.

## Week: 17 October 2022

### What brought you joy this week?

* Running the Intro to GitHub session - it was nice to do that again after a long while even if it was not very streamlined. I hope folks attending got something out of it.
* Good chats in the co-working session.

### What did you achieve

* I set up this repo and started formalizing tasks.

### What did you struggle with?

* Still felt a bit all over the place and didn't spend too much focus time on things.

### Any other topics

* Managed to attend parts of the Science Europe Open Science conference, didn't feel I learned too many new things though.
* Did my SSI Fellowship shortlisting which was super nice again
* Progressed some consultancy discussions
