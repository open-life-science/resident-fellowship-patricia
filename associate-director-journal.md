* Quite a few meetings didn't happen and my brain isn't the best at switching from "I'm prepared for all the meetings" to just quietly work - so not sure how productive I was.

### Any other topics

Delivered a really nice workshop as freelancer. Huge impostor syndrome about getting it right, turns out, I should probably do more of this.
