## Week: 1 September 2025

### What brought you joy this week?

* Co-working sessions with Yo were productive.

### What did you achieve?
* 1-1/Onboarding Sara
* Plenty of contract amendments
* Some issuing of invoices
* Lots of finance inbox triage
* ESTA and booking flights
* Wrapping my head around new CZI reporting part 1
* Leadership catch-ups and workload planning (it's not looking good)
* Finalizing DRA OS Retreat contract
* Reviewing some RCMCoop docs and hopefully getting to a point where we can unblock Cass on a few things.
* FSC co-working to create more to dos
* Some comms with PEM
* Become officially a director!

### What did you struggle with?

* More uncertainty and curve balls. It's very busy and we're underresourced, so it will be "fun" for the next few weeks.

### Any other topics

* Keeping days off at least to make sure there's some opportunity to rest.
