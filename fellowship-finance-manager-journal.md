## Week: 13 November 2023

### What brought you joy this week?

* Putting the OLS team reflection thoughts into practice.
 
### What did you achieve?

* Turing SPA project reporting
* Supporting the Ally Skills workshop without having a nervous breakdown
* Finally looking at some of the governance docs that have been on the to do list - not sure I contributed much though

### What did you struggle with?

* Feeling not well prepared and like an impostor for the Ally Skills session.
* There are still finance things that trip me up - nothing that can't be sorted somehow though.

### Any other topics

* Busy week - didn't stress out too much I think but definitely ran a bit out of steam on Friday...

## Week: 6 November 2023

* Some Ally Skills workshop prep.

### What did you struggle with?

### Any other topics

* Not at the moment.

### Any other topics

* Getting to a point where the overall work balance seems to work out - so that's good. Feeling ready to reflect and prep for 2024 already, maybe it's the stormy weather that makes me want to curl up and think.
